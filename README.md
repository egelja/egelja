## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nikola!

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu), working with Prof. [Josiah Hester](https://josiahhester.com/) in the [Ka Moamoa](https://kamoamoa.com/) lab.
My research is focused on systems for embedded and intermittent computing, trying to find ways to run complex applications in challenging and constrained environments.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I did work on quantum computing and computer architecture at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), under the supervision of
Prof. [Nikos Hardavellas](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hardav/) in the [PARAG@N Lab](https://paragon.cs.northwestern.edu/). While at NU, I obtained a BS in Computer Science
and a MS in Computer Engineering.
